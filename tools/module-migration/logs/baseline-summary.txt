=== BASELINE BUILD SUMMARY ===

Date: 2025-12-11
Branch: epix/modules/00-baseline-build

ENVIRONMENT:
- OS: Linux (Ubuntu 24.04)
- CMake: 3.31.6
- C++ Compiler: GCC 13.3.0 (g++)
- C Compiler: GCC 13.3.0 (gcc)
- Alternative Compiler: Clang 18.1.3

CMAKE CONFIGURATION:
Command: cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++ -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc \
         -DGLFW_BUILD_WAYLAND=OFF -DGLFW_BUILD_X11=OFF \
         -DEARCUT_BUILD_VIZ=OFF -DEARCUT_BUILD_TESTS=OFF -DEARCUT_BUILD_BENCH=OFF

Configuration: SUCCESS
- Third-party libraries: Successfully configured
- Git submodules: Initialized and checked out
- C++ Standard: C++23 (set in main CMakeLists.txt)

BUILD STATUS:
Command: cmake --build . -j$(nproc)

Build Result: PARTIAL FAILURE (expected in headless environment)

Failures:
1. volk: Missing vulkan/vk_platform.h header
   - Volk is a Vulkan meta-loader that requires Vulkan headers
   - This is expected without system Vulkan SDK

2. imgui: Missing GL/gl.h header  
   - ImGui GLFW backend requires OpenGL headers
   - This is expected without system OpenGL development libraries

Successful Builds:
- glfw (static library)
- glm (static library) 
- spdlog (static library)
- freetype (static library)
- Several other third-party libraries compiled successfully

NOTES FOR MODULE MIGRATION:
1. The project uses CMake with modern features (3.21+)
2. Current C++ standard is C++23, modules will use C++20
3. The engine has clear separation between epix_engine/ and libs/
4. Build system is already set up for multiple modules (core, input, assets, window, transform, image, render, sprite)
5. Third-party dependencies are well-isolated in libs/ directory

NEXT STEPS:
Step 1 will perform discovery on epix_engine/ directory only (not libs/)
to generate dependency graph and identify module candidates.

The build failures are environmental (missing graphics libraries) and 
don't affect the module migration strategy or discovery process.
